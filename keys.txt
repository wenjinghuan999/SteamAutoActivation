Key file example

It is best to make sure each key is in a seperated line, e.g.
AAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA

Keys will be detected automatically, e.g.
This is a key BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB

Make sure keys only contain CAPITAL LETTERS, NUMBERS and -.
This key is invalid ccccc-ccccc-ccccc

Make sure the whole key is in the same line.
This key is invalid DDDDD-DDDD
D-DDDDD

Other lines will be ignored.
